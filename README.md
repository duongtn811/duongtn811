# Hi, I'm Duong ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Vietnam. I grew up in a small rice-farming village so my journey from a rural village to the tech industry has been fueled by curiosity and a love for learning. I thrive on building innovative solutions and contributing to impactful projects.

ðŸŽ“ I study Computer Science from HCM University of Technology.  
ðŸ”­ I specialize in full-stack development, and I enjoy working with a variety of technologies to build robust and scalable applications. My primary stack includes:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js, and CSS for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, and Python for building powerful and efficient server-side applications.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL and MongoDB for managing and querying datasets.
